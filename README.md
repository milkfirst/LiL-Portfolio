# Welcome to my Portfolio!
Hello, it's so nice to meet you. My name is Lalaine aka LiL, and I'm based in London as well as Toronto.
My portfolio website contains my best work front-end work and UI/UX design throughout my educational career at Fanshawe College. It also contains my work from graphic design, Cinema 4D and all the other causes of my sleepless nights. Haha.
Hope you enjoy! :D
